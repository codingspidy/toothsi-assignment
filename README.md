# Keynotes

~ This project is built with React.js and tailwindcss and reduxjs-toolkit used for state management of cart.
~ I didn't find any dummy API that returns color and inStock details of the product. So, instead I have used product description and rating.
~ Product size was also not available. Hence the second select filter is based on product rating.

## For running locally:

Clone the project locally.
In the project directory, run: ### `npm install`

Finally run: ### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
