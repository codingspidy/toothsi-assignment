# Toothsi assignment❤️

This project is built with React.js and tailwindcss and reduxjs-toolkit used for state management of cart.

All the features mentioned in the assignment details are implemented successfully ---

~Fetch data from dummy API and display on the homepage~On clicking Add to cart button, add all checked items to cart and redirect to checkout page~Allow users input to determine quantity of product to be added to the cart.

~Filter products on the basis of filters applied~Reset filters when reset button clicked~Filter products on the basis of user Search input.

~Allow users to increase/decrease quantity of products on the checkout page~Display subtotal of a product and total of whole cart~On clicking proceed checkout button, redirect user to thankyou page.

Note: I couldn't find any dummy API that returns color and inStock details of the product.
So, instead I have used product description and rating.
Product size was also not available. Hence the second select filter is based on product rating.
